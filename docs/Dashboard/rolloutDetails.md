### Rollout Details

The **UpdateHub** also gives all the information with the details of each specific `Rollout`, allowing a complete overview of the individual process. Among the information displayed inside the `Rollout Details` you will find:

- *Version*: The version of `Rollout` that the `Device` will receive.
- *Creation Date*: The date that the `Rollout` was created.
- *Tasks*: This area shows the each task that is part of the `Rollout`. Each task includes a number of information, such as:
    - *Number of `Devices`*: All the `Devices` available for the `Rollout`, including the number of process concluded, failed, and remaining in one or various tasks are displayed here.
    - *Fault tolerance*: that's the percentage limit of failures which can occur during the `Rollout` until the **UpdateHub** aborts the running rollout process, including any pending tasks.
- *Play/Pause `Rollout`*: Whenever the user wants to play or pause the `Rollout` the option is available, unless the process is aborted or the user chooses to archive it.
- *Archive the `Rollout`*: Once the rollout is not necessary anymore it can be archived and stopped definitely.
