## Creating a Rollout

There are two methods to execute the `Rollout`.

The simpler way shows all the versions of the `Devices` present on the field to be updated at once.

You just need to go to the `Overview` or `Rollouts` page and click on `Create Rollout`. A box to choose the *version* will appear. After you make this choice just click on `Save` to initiate the `Rollout` later or `Save and Start` launch it straightaway.

Keep in mind that this method will trigger the `Rollout` for all the `Devices` accessible for the `Product` chosen, with no restrictions concerning the different hardware or other aspects of the fleet on the field. If the user desires to select which equipment receives the `Rollout` the **updatehub** offers the `Advanced Rollout` option.
