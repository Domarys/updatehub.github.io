### Device Details

The `Device Details` page provides you access to detailed information about a specific `Device` such as:

- The Unique Identifier (UID)
- The device identity values (e.g. MAC* address, CPU serial number or other)
- Current installed device version
- Hardware model
- The device `Rollout` history.
- Device state (enabled or disabled)
- Device attributes

The **updatehub** delivers a complete history about the `Rollout` so the user can check the update's health while it's happening or after it's finished. Besides, with all the information about the device available the user may find easier solutions for any situation that appear.
