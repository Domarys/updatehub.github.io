## Creating a Product

To create a product you need to access the `Products` page by clicking on **updatehub** logo in the navigation bar. On the `Products` page click`Add Product`.

After clicking on `Create` button a dialog will show the product unique identifier that is used in your build system configuration.

Once you have logged in, the `Products` page will display the list of your own products and the other products you have access to.
