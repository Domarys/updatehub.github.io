### Access Key

To authenticate and authorize requests for a project build with the **updatehub** you must have a security credential in the form of an application access key. Each access key is specific to your user and is used to upload the packages update or any other external integration which needs to access the **updatehub** API.

In order to generate an Access Key you must enter the `Settings` menu and click on the `+ Request Access Key` button. Choose a name for the key and select the API Key owner as `Me`.

Once the access key is created a dialog will appear to show the security credentials. On the moment that this window is closed the keys will not be showed again and if you lose them you must revoke the Access Key and generate a new one.
