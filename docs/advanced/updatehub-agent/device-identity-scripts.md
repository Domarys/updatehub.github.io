Each device connected to **updatehub** Server must have a unique *uuid* which is generated
by *Device Identity Scripts*.

The default setup of [**updatehub** Agent](/advanced/updatehub-agent/overview.md)
provides a collection of scripts to generate a unique *uuid* for each device.
These scripts are hosted in a [repository](https://github.com/updatehub/device-identity).
