Through the dashboard you, as the [**UpdateHub** user](https://dashboard.updatehub.io/), have a rich but simple interface with all the tools required to:

* Create and operate your own *Products*
* Access *Products* from the *Organizations* you have access
* Check when new *Packages* are available for updates
* Oversee a fleet of *Devices* on the field
* Deploy updates via an Over-The-Air using *Rollouts*

Essentially, the dashboard allows the oversight over the whole **UpdateHub** platform and its operations, making it easy to manage any need that you might have.
